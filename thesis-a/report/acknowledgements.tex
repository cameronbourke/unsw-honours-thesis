\chapter*{Acknowledgements}\label{ch:ack}

I would like to firstly thank Gernot Heiser, for his guidance and expertise throughout Term 1. The same can be said for Peter Chubb, who has been a wonderful wealth of information regarding seL4 and the lower level details of the platform. I would like to thank the many individuals within the Trustworthy Systems (TS) team who have been immensely welcoming and generous with their time.

Since I was not able to take AOS before starting this thesis, I owe much of my working knowledge about seL4 to James Archer and Courtney Darville. In the wider community, the numerous blog posts and talks by Brendan Gregg were immensely useful in understanding how to use the perf utility on Linux.

Finally, I would like to thank my partner Olivia, for her unconditional support and sacrifice throughout my degree and this thesis. I am incredibly grateful.
